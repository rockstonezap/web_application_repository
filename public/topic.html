                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. Origin of Competitive Chess</h2>

                        <p>
                            The first tournaments of chess were in Leeds 1941 and in Amsterdam in 1951,
                            however the first international chess tournament was held in London 1951
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first tournaments of chess lacked some rules when it came to the format of the games
                            along with the fact that it lasted for a long time (Some games could last between 8 and 10 hours because of the participants stalling),
                            which is considered too time taking. For that reason, later on, rules were established on timer formats.
                            Timer formats were established in the 1880s and it consists in establishing a limited time per person in a game.
                            At first, the analog clock was used, which had only two modes: Absolute time (Set amount of time to play your moves)
                            and Canadian Overtime (Requirement to play a set amount of moves in a set amount of time, after which the time resets).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This timer is what managed to make chess tournaments more dynamic and less time consuming and allowed for the birth of new types of chess tournament formats.
                            The most popular formats are the Blitz and Rapid formats, which consist of 3 minutes and 10 minutes per person respectively
                            (Blitz covers formats between 30sec and 5min while Rapid covers between 10min and 45min).
                            Bobby Fisher considered this type of timing for games to enable the players to try to stall their games to win the game by the opponent running out of time.
                            For that reason, Bobby Fisher patented a timer in 1988, that enabled the addition of bonus time to the player per move made.
                            This timer is now used in all competitive chess, and is the most important aspect of competitive chess.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            An important event in history for competitive chess was the birth of FIDE, the International Chess Federation, in 1924.
                            Previously, before 1924, chess was considered whether it should be included in the Olympic Games, however since it was very
                            difficult to distinguish the amateur players from the professional players, this event was called off.
                            However, the first unofficial Chess Olympiad was created right when the Olympic Games were held in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.
                            After this unofficial Chess Olympiad, the "Fédération Internationale des Échecs" (FIDE) was created.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The federation is responsible for the organization of all international chess tournaments and the establishment of the rules of chess.
                            These rules are all found in the FIDE rule handbook, you can find the handbook for
                            <a href="https://handbook.fide.com/">FIDE's rules and regulations here.</a>
                            The most important rule established by FIDE is the Elo rating system, which is a system that allows for the ranking
                            of players based on their performance in tournaments. This system is used in all competitive chess tournaments
                            and is the most important aspect of competitive chess.
                            Additionally, FIDE is responsible for the creation of new tournament formats along with the modifications of current existing formats.
                            Most of the format modifications were made in the World Championship, as the federation could not settle for a proper format for the tournament.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Tournament Formats</h2>

                        <p>There have been many tournament formats utilised over the times, however these are the currently used and approved by FIDE:</p>

                        <h3>Round-robin</h3>

                        <p>In a round-robin tournament, everyone plays each other an equal amount of times. Elo Ratings are sometimes used to separate players into distinct groups in round-robin.</p>

                        <p>This format is typically used for small groups of players, as this reduces the aspect of luck.</p>

                        <p>The scoring system (Win/Draw/Loss) follows the 1-1/2-0 format, but in recent times a 3-1-0 system is being experimented with, to encourage players to go for the wins</p>

                        <h3>Swiss System</h3>

                        <p>This type of format is typically used when there is an excess amount of players. Often times, this
                            format is used for chess tournaments that are not as competitive, like in the elo ratings below 2000 etc.</p>

                        <p>A key aspect of this format is that the players do not face the same opponent more than once, and the number of
                            games with white and black is equalized (or with a difference of 1 if amount of rounds is odd)</p>

                        <p>In this type of format, due to the increase of draws, its common to find many players with the same score at the end of all the rounds.</p>

                        <p>This is not typically an issue when it comes to first places (Price often split) but sometimes, a tiebreak system is used.</p>

                        <p>A tiebreak typically compares the following data: </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Sonneborn–Berger score (Sums the score of each opponent won against plus half of the score of each opponent drawn against).</li>
                            <li>Rating Performance (Typically in accordance to the formula from FIDE)</li>
                            <li>Number of Wins, as White and as Black</li>
                            <li>Tiebreak Games (Used mainly in far more important events).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Elimination</h3>

                        <p>
                            Elimination consists of a knock-out style system. This means that for instance if a player loses, they get
                            eliminated from the tournament, however typically a system is set for those eliminated to
                            play each other to have a chance to get back into the tournament. This system is called the losers bracket
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Typically, in this format, it is avoided for higher rated players to play against each other at the start,
                            since one of the higher rated could end up in the losers bracket.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To ensure fairness, 2 games are typically played, each player playing with both white and black.
                            In case of same score, it goes into tiebreak, which depending on the tournament, can consist of
                            more games, or playing a different time format.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Scheveningen system</h3>

                        <p>
                            This system is typically used in team based events. A chess tournament that is team based consists of players
                            forming teams (typically either country, club or prior to the event) and they would get paired up in the tournament
                            to play against each other.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When teams are paired, each player from one team plays against another player from the other team.
                            The score per team on that round is dependent on the total score obtained by each player
                        </p>

                        <p>A team wins when their total score is higher than their opponent's team.</p>

                        <p>
                            These events typically award team prizes, but sometimes these events also award individual prices,
                            based on the highest scores obtained in the tournament
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. Time Formats</h2>

                        <p>
                            Every chess event, often has a specific time format set. As mentioned prior in the origin of chess tournaments,
                            the chess timer was created to avoid stalling in games, and to finish tournaments faster. As the chess timer was
                            introduced, different time formats were introduced, but with time, these were categorized into five types.
                            FIDE establishes the World Champion of each via a World Chess Championships for that time format.
                        </p>

                        <p>The five formats are the following: </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Bullet - 1 or 2 minutes per side</li>
                            <li>Blitz - 10 min or less</li>
                            <li>Rapid - Between 10 and 60 min</li>
                            <li>Classical - Typically 1h 30 min, but can vary in time from 1h to higher than 1h 30min</li>
                            <li>Standard - 2 hours for 40 moves and an extra hour (or less) added to each player when the 40 moves have been made</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Depending on the tournament organiser, there is the option to add increment time,
                            which means per move made, a slight amount of time will be added to yours. This time can vary.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A worthy mention is the Armaggeddon mode, where the players each blind to each other wager
                            an amount of time from their clock, and the one that wagered the most will be playing white
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is significant as in this mode, if you're white, when you draw, you lose while black wins.
                            This essentially forces white to go on the offensive and be more aggressive in the game
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4. Arbiters - What are they?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Arbiters are the people that survey and supervise the whole tournament. The arbiter's
                            responsibility is to sort out issues among players, note down the score of a game table, and
                            to make sure the FIDE rules are being followed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some tournaments have higher security when it comes to devices or any electronical device
                            (because of possible assistance), and most the time arbiters are also responsible for making
                            sure there is no sort of devices violating the FIDE rules.
                        </p>

                        <p>Arbiters also have the right to kick out any spectator if they are not following the rules and regulations.</p>

                        <p>Arbiters can also kick out a player if under reasonable suspicion with possible evidence of a player cheating.</p>

                        <p>
                            Depending on how grave the cheating was done by the player, the arbiter can decide on a ban of the player
                            from chess tournaments for a set amount of time or a permanent ban from the FIDE and any chess tournaments
                            related to FIDE. These things though typically have to be reported to FIDE first for approval before any specific action,
                            but any games where the cheater played are typically nulled out, without any result for fair play policy.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5. Key Rules in Competitive Chess</h2>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Touch-Move Rule: When a piece is moved, you're obliged to move it in that turn.</li>
                            <li>A move cannot be retracted if the piece has already been moved unless the move is illegal.</li>
                            <li>
