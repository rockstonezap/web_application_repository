                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Overview Content</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course is designed to provide an understanding of computer
                        engineering from both academic and professional perspectives. It equips students with foundational knowledge of the
                        architecture of computers, how they and the infrastructure currently used in our daily lives communicate with each other,
                        a perspective into the current market for computer engineers of various types along with details into the AI
                        adoption while also introducing the diverse career opportunities available to computer engineers and their critical role in contemporary society.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The course is divided into two main parts. The first part focuses on theoretical foundations and is structured into three key blocks.
                        The first block, Computer Engineering in Society, examines the historical background of the field, exploring its evolution from past
                        to present and projecting its future. It also points out the discipline as both an academic pursuit and a professional career.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second block, Information and Data, delves into the representation and organisation of information.
                        It introduces fundamental concepts such as number systems, data coding, and models, alongside contemporary topics like Big Data,
                        data protection, and the legal and ethical challenges surrounding information management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The third block, Information Processing, Management, and Transmission addresses the structure and functionality of computer systems,
                        including hardware, software, operating systems, and networks. It explores modern paradigms and technologies such as cloud computing,
                        quantum computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, IoT, and smart cities, highlighting their interconnected roles
                        in modern computing landscapes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second part of the course transitions into the development of practical skills. Students are introduced to web development through
                        two projects that involve the research into a cherry-picked topic from the list provided by the teacher and the creation of a web page
                        on topics related to the course content. This practical component provides experience with soft skills such as teamwork, perseverance
                        and communication. By developing technical and interpersonal skills, the course fosters the comprehensive development of future computer
                        engineers, aligning with the universityâ€™s broader educational objectives.
                    </p>
