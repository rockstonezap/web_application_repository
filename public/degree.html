                                        problems using general problem-solving methods. It emphasizes two core elements: problem representation and solution acquisition.
                                        Key topics include symbolic AI definitions and techniques, symbolic processing models (especially state-space-based),
                                        and search algorithms such as uninformed, heuristic, adversarial, and constraint-based searches. Students will apply
                                        these algorithms to real-world problems, like video games and route optimization, by programming practical solutions.

                                        The Final Degree Project (PFG) provides students with the opportunity to complete a comprehensive computer project,
                                        integrating knowledge from their Computer Engineering studies while adopting an engineering and research-oriented perspective.
                                        Students will develop technical projects, prepare reports, draft technical papers, and present their work orally.
                                        The course emphasizes project planning using appropriate methodologies and expanding knowledge through research and consultation
                                        of relevant bibliographic sources.

                                        This course emphasizes the transition from viewing Computer Systems Management as an art to treating it as an engineering discipline,
                                        focusing on effective planning and project management. It highlights the importance of team management and human relationships
                                        in achieving successful project outcomes, while aligning projects with client needs and fostering personal and professional growth.
                                        Students will learn standard IT project management methods, techniques for defining and managing projects, and skills for planning,
                                        controlling, and monitoring. The course also includes applying these principles and competencies to a real-world project.
